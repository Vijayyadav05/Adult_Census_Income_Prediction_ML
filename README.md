# Adult Census Income Prediction
## Project Overview:
The project focuses on predicting income levels using the 1994 Census Bureau dataset. The goal is to analyze how various demographic and economic factors influence whether an individual earns above or below $50,000 annually. Machine learning techniques are applied to identify patterns and trends related to income inequality.

## Objective:
The objective is to demonstrate how machine learning can predict income brackets based on demographic data. The analysis seeks to identify the underlying drivers of income inequality, offering insights for economic policy and decision-making

## Findings:

Income Distribution: Around 76% of individuals earn less than $50,000 annually, while 24% earn more.

Age: Younger individuals (15-30 years) mostly earn below $50,000, while those aged 40-59 are more likely to earn above $50,000.

Education: Individuals with Doctorate, Professional School, or Masterâ€™s degrees are more likely to earn above $50,000.

Occupation: Executive and managerial roles are associated with higher incomes, while those in armed forces tend to earn less.

Gender and Race: White men are more likely to earn above $50,000 compared to other races and women

## Report:
The dataset contains 32,537 records with 14 features. Key features influencing income include age, education, occupation, and work hours. The steps involved in the project include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and deployment. Machine learning models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest, were employed, with accuracy improvements through SMOTE to handle class imbalance

## Conclusion:
The project successfully used machine learning to predict whether an individual earns above $50,000 based on demographic and occupational factors. Key predictors include education level, occupation, and work hours. The analysis offers valuable insights for addressing income inequality and influencing economic policies
